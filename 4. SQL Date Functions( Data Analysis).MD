## Question 1
Write a query that displays the rescue date.
For this query, we will use the function DAY(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be only the DAY part of the date in the column. The query for this question can be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
In case the query was asking for MONTH of rescue, the query would change to:

``` SQL
SELECT MONTH(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
In case the query was asking for YEAR of rescue, the query would change to:

``` SQL
SELECT YEAR(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
```

## Question 2
Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrival. Write a query that displays the third day of each rescue.
For this query, we will use the function DATE_ADD(COLUMN_NAME, INTERVAL Number Date_element). Here, the quantity in Number and in Date_element will combine to form the interval to be added to the date in the column. For the given question, the query would be:

``` SQL
SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE
```
If the question was to add 2 months to the date, the query would change to:

``` SQL
SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 2 MONTH) FROM PETRESCUE
```
## Question 3
Similarly, we can retrieve a date before the one given in the column by a given number using the function DATE_SUB. By modifying the same example, the following query would provide the date 3 days before the rescue.

``` SQL
SELECT DATE_SUB(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE
```

## Question 4
Write a query that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued, for example, the difference between the current date and the rescue date.
For this query, we will use the function DATEDIFF(Date_``` SQL, Date_2). This function calculates the difference between the two given dates and gives the output in number of days. For the given question, the query would be:

``` SQL
SELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE
```

## Question 5
CURRENT_DATE is also an inbuilt function that returns the present date as known to the server.

To present the output in a YYYY-MM-DD format, another function FROM_DAYS(number_of_days)can be used. This function takes a number of days and returns the required formatted output. The query above would thus be modified to

``` SQL
SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE)) FROM PETRESCUE
