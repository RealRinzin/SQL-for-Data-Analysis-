```
1. Question 

Write a query that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
For this query, we will use the function SUM(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the total value of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as:
```

``` SQL
SELECT SUM(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
You can further assign a label to the query SUM_OF_COST.

``` SQL
SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST FROM PETRESCUE;
```
Write a query that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued (of any kind).
For this query, we will use the function MAX(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the maximum value of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
The query can easily be changed to display the minimum quantity using the MIN function instead.

``` SQL
SELECT MIN(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;
```

Write a query that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
For this query, we will use AVG(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the average of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as
``` SQL
SELECT AVG(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
