### Scalar Functions and String Functions

Write a query that displays the rounded integral cost of each rescue.
For this query, we will use the function ROUND(COLUMN_NAME, NUMBER_OF_DECIMALS). The output of this query will be the value of each element in the column rounded to the specified number of decimal places. Note that the second argument is optional and, if omitted, results in rounding to an integer value. The query for this question can be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT ROUND(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;
Copied!
The query could also be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT ROUND(COST, 0) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
In case the question was to round the value to 2 decimal places, the query would change to:

``` SQL
SELECT ROUND(COST, 2) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
Write a query that displays the length of each animal name.
For this query, we will use the function LENGTH(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the length of each element in the column. The query for this question can be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
Write a query that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
For this query, we will use the function UCASE(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be each element in the column in upper case letters. The query for this question can be written as:

``` SQL
SELECT UCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
Just as easily, the user could ask for a lower case representation, and the query would be changed to:

``` SQL
SELECT LCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
